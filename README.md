# *Udacity Self Driving Car Engineer Course*
## **Project NÂº 1: Object Detection in an Urban Environment**

### **Project Introduction:**
<div style="text-align: justify"> your-text-hereIn this project, you will apply the skills you have gained in this course to create a convolutional neural network to detect and classify objects using data from Waymo. You will be provided with a dataset of images of urban environments containing annotated cyclists, pedestrians and vehicles.
First, you will perform an extensive data analysis including the computation of label distributions, display of sample images, and checking for object occlusions. </div>
