# *Results of the project #1: Object Detection in an Urban Environmets*

## *1) Random images in that the trained algorithm detect "cars (red)", "pedestrian (blue)" and "cycles (green)":*

Sample pictures shows Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in that we can see the bounding boxes marking the differents detected objects.

## *2) Histogram indicating Qty=f(classes):*

The graphics shows the quantity of different classes detected in the dataset.

## *3) First training without augmentation:*
The curves shows the learning courves without augmentation.
