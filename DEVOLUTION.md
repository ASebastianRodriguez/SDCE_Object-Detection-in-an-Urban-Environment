In this project you have developed an Object detection based on SSD. Remember that single-stage architectures are preferred for autonomous vehicles because they provide a higher frame rate than other architectures (e.g. Dual-stage encoders such as R-CNN).
However, SSD is not the only single-stage encoder network. YOLO is another great single-stage network that is very popular in the automotive industry. For instance, you can see a comparison of both in the following paper from a couple of years ago. A relevant part of this paper is the comparison chart between YOLO and SSD, as shown below:
